# Architectural Directive: World ID Orb Availability Constraint and Fallback Decision

**Decision Date:** 2026-09-05

## Decision Context (Human Architect)

To demo the relayer's three-state logic (`backed` / `unbacked` / `unknown`) fully, the
`backed` branch needs a test agent address that has actually completed a real World ID Orb
verification — not a mocked or asserted status. Investigation into how to obtain one
surfaced an external constraint, not an engineering one:

1. **The Orb requirement is cryptographic-structural, not a policy setting.** A live
   `cast call` against the deployed AgentBook contract
   (`0xA23aB2712eA7BBa896930544C7d6636a96b944dA`, World Chain) reads `groupId() == 1`.
   Per `world-id-contracts`' own documentation (`docs/user-flows.md`): "the `WorldIDRouter`
   will route the proof to the specified group (0 - Phone, 1 - Orb)" — group 0 and group 1
   are structurally separate Merkle trees, not tiers within one tree. A Device/Phone-level
   World ID proof cannot satisfy `verifyProof(root, groupId=1, ...)`; the identity was never
   inserted into that tree. This is not a restriction AgentKit chose to enforce more
   strictly than necessary — it is what the deployed contract's own configuration requires.
2. **Taiwan currently has no stably operating Orb location.** Biometric-data collection is
   regulated by Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC); historical Orb locations here have been repeatedly removed
   under regulatory pressure. This is an external, jurisdiction-level constraint, not
   something resolvable within this project's scope or timeline.
3. **A possible mitigation exists but is unconfirmed.** ETHGlobal's own ETHOnline 2026
   AgentKit Continuity prize page lists "Uses the World ID Sandbox App to test the project
   remotely" as a qualification criterion, with a real Sandbox Access request channel
   (Firebase App Distribution beta, requested via the form ETHGlobal links). Access has been
   requested. As of this decision, it is **not confirmed** whether a proof generated through
   this sandbox can satisfy AgentBook's on-chain `groupId=1` check — official AgentKit docs
   (`docs.world.org/agents/agent-kit/integrate`) make no mention of this sandbox at all, so
   compatibility cannot be verified from documentation alone. This is recorded as a pending
   verification item, not as a known-working path.

## Core Directives Given to Claude Code

Adopt a fallback plan now, rather than letting an unresolved external dependency block the
hackathon submission timeline:

- If Sandbox Access is confirmed working before submission, use it to register a real
  `backed` test address and demo that branch live, same as `unbacked` already is.
- If it cannot be confirmed workable in time, the demo shows the `unbacked` scenario in
  full — already completely verified against real on-chain data (see the decision-engine's
  57/57 live AgentBook reads, all correctly returning `unbacked` for freshly generated,
  genuinely unregistered addresses). For the `backed` branch specifically, the README's
  Honest Disclosure will state plainly that its logic correctness was confirmed via code
  review and unit tests (`relayer/src/agent-book.js`'s three-state read, exercised in
  `relayer/test/replay.test.js` and `decision-engine/test/`), not a live on-chain test — and
  that the reason is a regional regulatory constraint on Orb availability, not an unverified
  or untested code path being passed off as verified.

## Implementation & Trade-off Constraints

This is a disclosure decision, not a code change: nothing in `relayer/` or
`decision-engine/` is modified by this ADR. It commits the project to updating the README's
Honest Disclosure section with the exact framing above once the Sandbox Access outcome is
known (either a live `backed` demo, or the disclosed code-review-only caveat) — not before,
since the outcome is still pending as of this decision.

This follows the project's existing honest-disclosure precedent rather than introducing a
new one: disclosing a real limitation with its exact cause, instead of either hiding it or
overstating what has actually been verified. See the genesis-round decimals-anomaly
disclosure (`docs/spec.md`) and the relayer's own "trusted-signer bridge, not
trust-minimized" disclosure (root `README.md`, Honest Disclosure section) for the same
pattern applied elsewhere in this project.

## Update (2026-09-09): Sandbox access tested, still blocked

World ID Sandbox access arrived via Firebase App Distribution email on
2026-09-09. This section records what we found after testing it.

The sandbox app's own verification flow asks for a passport scan, then
asks the user to find a nearby physical Orb. There is no simulated or
remote Orb path inside the app itself.

Separately, we traced `npx @worldcoin/agentkit-cli register` back to
its source (published npm package 0.2.0 and the `main` branch on
GitHub). The `register` command hardcodes a production `app_id`
(`app_a7c3e2b6b83927251a0db5345bd7146a`), not a staging one.
`idkit-core` decides whether to route to a staging environment by
checking if the `app_id` string contains `"staging"`. Since it
doesn't, every QR code this CLI generates points to the real World
App verification flow, regardless of which app scans it. The CLI's
own `REGISTRATION.md` documents a `--network base-sepolia` flag that
does not exist in the actual code, in either the published package
or `main`.

Both paths, the sandbox app's built-in flow and the CLI's
registration flow, lead back to a physical Orb requirement. Neither
provides a way to test the `backed` branch without one.

This doesn't rule out that some other undocumented path exists. It
only means we didn't find one after checking both entry points
available to us in the time we had. We're leaving this constraint
in place rather than closing it out, and the `backed` branch remains
verified by code review and unit tests only, as stated in the main
Honest Disclosure section.
